I want an outline for the article provided its title.

Here's the format you should follow:

```json
{
  "title": "title of the article",
  "outline": [
    {
      "type": "", // available types are heading2, heading3, heading4, heading5, heading6
      "text": "", // text is the content of the heading
      "points": [] // points to be written, should be texts. I.e choosing the right tank
    }
  ]
}
```

Give me a full outline with lots of details for this article {title}.
